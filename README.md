## 📂 Repository Structure  

- **`leetcode_problems/`** → Direct solutions to problems by number/name.  
- **`patterns/`** → Grouped problems based on recurring problem-solving patterns (e.g., sliding window, dynamic programming, two-pointer, graph traversal).  
- **`practice_problems/`** → Extra practice and variations to strengthen problem-solving.  

---

## 🛠️ Languages & Tools  

- **Python 3** (primary language)  
- Standard libraries: `collections`, `heapq`, `itertools`, `bisect`, etc.  

---

## ✨ Features  

- **Pattern-based learning** → Problems grouped to identify reusable techniques.  
- **Readable code** → Clean Pythonic implementations with comments.  
- **Complexity analysis** → Where possible, solutions include **time and space complexity**.  
- **Scalability mindset** → Focus on writing efficient code for large inputs.
